+++

I am a Postdoc fellow in the [Astrophysics group](http://fisica.mib.infn.it/media/homepages/astrofisica/) of the 
[Università degli Studi di Milano - Bicocca](www.unimib.it).
I obtained my PhD in November 2014 at the [Università degli Studi dell'Insubria](www.uninsubria.it), 
working at the Brera Observatory ([INAF-OAB](www.brera.inaf.it)) 
and at the European Southern Observatory ([ESO](www.eso.org)). 
I collaborate with the [high energy astrophysics group](http://meratehighenergy.blogspot.it/) of INAF-OAB in Merate. 

My work is focused on **Active Galactic Nuclei**. 
I am currently studying the highest redshift quasars known, 
to understand how the most massive black holes in the early Universe 
could form in their (very) short life-time. 
The main part of my work is devoted to blazars. 
Thanks to their peculiar orientation, they are the perfect 
tools to study the role of jets in the physics of Active Galactic Nuclei.
